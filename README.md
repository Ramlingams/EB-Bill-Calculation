# EB Bill Calculator (Python)

A simple command-line EB (Electricity Board) bill calculator.

## What it does
- Calculates the energy charge using slab-wise rates.
- Adds a fixed charge, electricity duty, and GST.
- Prints a neat breakdown of the bill.

## How to run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Unzip the package and run:
   ```bash
   python eb_bill_calculator.py
   ```
3. Follow prompts to enter units and optionally edit slab rates/charges.

## Notes
- The slab rates used in the example are **sample values**. Replace them with your state's official rates for exact billing.
- This is a learning/demo application — not intended to replace official EB software.
